# Quadratic equation
The code help to get the quadratic equation and to test it

# How to use
python quadratic_equation.py 
open the project and unittest tests.py
# How to run

Needed python interpreter 3.5 onboard, as well as math and unittest libraries
for using as imported function do "from quadratic_equation import get_roots", in which get_roots(a,b,c) will be your
variables

Linux-like run:

```bash
python quadratic_equation.py for main work
python tests.py  for testing the script# 
```

Windows-like run - the same

# Project goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
